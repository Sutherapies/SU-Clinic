Living with the discomfort of pelvic organ prolapse—that feeling of heaviness, pressure, or a noticeable bulge—can be distressing and isolating. If you’re worried about your symptoms but the thought of invasive surgery feels daunting, please know there is a gentle, effective, and non-surgical path forward. This path often involves a simple, supportive device called a pessary. It’s a discreet solution designed to comfortably manage your symptoms, helping you to regain control and get back to the activities you love without fear or discomfort.

In this guide, we will compassionately walk you through everything you need to know. We’ll explore what a pessary is, how it works, and what to expect from a confidential fitting with a specialist physiotherapist. Our goal is to empower you with clear, evidence-based information so you can make the best choice for your body and reclaim your active, confident lifestyle.

Understanding the Pessary: A Simple Support System for Your Pelvic Floor
If you're exploring non-surgical options for pelvic floor concerns, you may have come across the term pessary. Put simply, it’s a soft, flexible device made from medical-grade silicone. The best way to think of it is like a sports support or an orthotic, but designed specifically to help your internal pelvic organs.

This support is essentially a prosthetic device inserted into the vagina to provide gentle, structural reinforcement. It works by carefully lifting and holding your pelvic organs—such as the bladder, uterus, or bowel—in their correct position. This can immediately alleviate the feelings of pressure, bulging, and discomfort often associated with prolapse.

To help you visualise how this works, this short video offers a clear explanation:


What Does a Pessary Help With?
A correctly fitted device is a versatile and effective tool for managing a range of pelvic health conditions. A specialist physiotherapist may recommend one to help with:

Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP): Providing reliable support for a descended bladder (cystocele), rectum (rectocele), or uterus (uterine prolapse).
Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI): Reducing or stopping bladder leaks that happen when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or exercise.
Temporary Support: Offering extra stability during pregnancy or in the postpartum period as your body recovers safely.
How is a Pessary Different from Other Devices?
It's important to understand that a pessary serves a unique therapeutic purpose. Unlike a menstrual cup, which is designed to collect fluid, its function is to provide physical support. It is also different from a contraceptive diaphragm, which is used for birth control. A correctly fitted pessary is a long-term management tool, designed to be worn comfortably for extended periods to help you regain confidence and get back to your daily activities without discomfort or surgery.

Common Types of Pessaries: Finding the Right Shape for You
One of the most common questions we hear is, “Which pessary is right for me?” The answer is that it’s deeply personal. Pessaries come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, each designed to support different types of prolapse and suit unique anatomies. While the number of options can seem daunting, a specialist physiotherapist is expertly trained to assess your specific needs and find the perfect fit for your body. While a clinical overview of pessary use shows dozens of designs, most women find lasting comfort and relief with one of a few common types.

The goal is always to find a solution that is so comfortable and effective, you can forget it’s there and get on with your life.

The Ring Pessary
Often the first choice for managing mild to moderate prolapse, the ring pessary is simple and effective. As the name suggests, it is a soft, flexible O-shaped ring that can be folded for gentle insertion. Once inside, it opens up to provide foundational support to the vaginal walls. Some ring types are designed so that you can learn to remove and re-insert them yourself at home, offering greater flexibility for activities like intercourse.

The Gellhorn or Cube Pessary
When a more significant prolapse requires greater support, a Gellhorn or Cube pessary may be recommended. These are designed to hold their position more securely. The Gellhorn uses a broad, supportive base and a small stem to hold everything in place, while the Cube uses the gentle suction of its concave sides to adhere to the vaginal walls. Because of their design, these types are almost always managed by your healthcare provider, who will remove, clean, and refit them for you at regular appointments.

Other Specialised Shapes
Beyond these common options, there are many other specialised shapes, such as the Donut (a thicker, rounder ring for more severe prolapse) or the Hodge (which is shaped specifically to support the bladder). However, the specific name or shape of the pessary is far less important than the expertise of the fitting. Our priority is to work with you to find the device that provides the best support with the most comfort, giving you the confidence to return to the activities you love.

Your Pessary Fitting Journey: A Compassionate, Step-by-Step Guide
The thought of a pessary fitting can feel daunting, but our goal is to make it a positive and empowering experience. At SU Therapies, we see this as a collaborative journey to help you regain comfort and confidence. Choosing a specialist women’s health physiotherapist is key, as they possess the deep anatomical knowledge and gentle touch required for a successful outcome. Our entire process is confidential and built on a simple, proven framework: we Assess your unique needs, Plan the right solution, and support your Progress towards your goals.

Step 1: The Initial Consultation & Assessment
Your journey begins in a safe, private space where we truly listen. We will talk through your symptoms, your lifestyle, and what you hope to achieve with treatment. This is followed by a gentle internal examination to assess the type and grade of your prolapse and the strength of your pelvic floor muscles. This vital information allows us to take precise measurements, ensuring we select the most appropriate initial pessary for your body.

Step 2: The Fitting Process
During the fitting, your physio will select a trial pessary and gently insert it. The most important goal is that you shouldn't be able to feel it once it's correctly positioned. To ensure it’s secure and comfortable during daily life, we'll ask you to perform a few simple movements, such as walking, coughing, and squatting. This real-world test helps us confirm the fit is stable. We will make any necessary adjustments right there and then, trying different sizes or shapes until we find your perfect match. Your comfort is our absolute priority.

Step 3: Follow-Up and Ongoing Care
Your fitting is just the beginning of our support. We will schedule a follow-up appointment, typically a few weeks later, to check how you are getting on and make any fine-tuning adjustments. If you have a self-managed device, we will teach you everything you need to know about its removal, cleaning, and re-insertion. For the best long-term results, we combine pessary use with a tailored pelvic floor exercise programme, empowering you to actively manage your health and well-being.

Living Comfortably with a Pessary: Your Questions Answered
Adapting to daily life after your fitting can bring up practical questions. It's completely normal to wonder how this small device will fit into your routine. The wonderful truth is that a well-fitted pessary is designed to give you your freedom back, not limit it. It’s a supportive tool to help you regain control and live life on your own terms, with confidence and comfort.

Daily Life, Exercise, and Activity
One of the most common questions we hear is, “Can I still be active?” The answer is a resounding yes. Your device is designed to support you through all of life’s movements. Whether it's running, swimming, attending a yoga class, or lifting your grandchildren, it should remain securely in place. The fear of it falling out is understandable, but with a professional, tailored fitting, this is extremely rare. It’s there to help you return to the activities you love, worry-free.

Intimacy and Sexual Activity
Pelvic health is closely linked to your overall well-being, including intimacy. Many women can continue to enjoy a fulfilling sex life. Depending on the type of device you have, your options may include:

Removal for intercourse: Some types, like a ring pessary, are easy to remove yourself and re-insert afterwards.
Leaving it in place: Other designs are shaped to allow for comfortable intercourse while they remain in situ.
Open communication with your partner and your pelvic health physiotherapist is key. We can discuss the most suitable options for you, ensuring you feel comfortable and confident.

Care, Cleaning, and Management
Management is straightforward. If you have a type you manage yourself, you’ll be shown how to remove, clean, and re-insert it. This usually just involves washing with warm water and a mild, non-perfumed soap. For clinic-managed devices, you will simply attend an appointment every 4-6 months for a professional clean and check. It's also normal to notice a slight, odourless increase in vaginal discharge, as your body naturally adjusts.

If you have any concerns about your device or wish to discuss your options, our compassionate team is here to help. Explore our specialist pelvic health services for personalised, confidential care.

Is a Pessary the Right Choice for You? Benefits and Considerations
Deciding on the best way to manage pelvic organ prolapse is a personal journey.

Supports your physiotherapy: By providing internal support, a pessary can make it easier and more comfortable to engage in your pelvic floor exercises, leading to better long-term results.
Completely reversible: If you decide it's not for you or your circumstances change, you can simply stop using it. There are no permanent changes to your body.
Potential Downsides and Considerations
To ensure a successful and comfortable experience, it's helpful to be aware of the practical aspects of ongoing use:

Ongoing care is required: The device needs to be removed and cleaned regularly, and you will need follow-up appointments to ensure everything remains healthy.
Possible irritation: An ill-fitting device can sometimes cause vaginal irritation or an increase in discharge. This is usually resolved by finding a better fit or different type.
The fitting process can take time: Finding the perfect shape and size for your body may require a bit of trial and error over one or two appointments. Patience is key to a successful outcome.

Frequently Asked Questions About Pessaries
Will I be able to feel the pessary once it's in?
A correctly fitted pessary should be completely comfortable, and you shouldn't be aware of it as you go about your day. It sits high in the vaginal canal, away from the more sensitive lower areas. If you can feel it, or if it causes any discomfort, it may not be the right size or shape for you. It’s important to contact your practitioner for a review so they can make the necessary adjustments to ensure a comfortable fit.

Can a pessary fall out when I go to the toilet?
While it is uncommon, a pessary can sometimes be expelled, particularly if you are straining to open your bowels. A well-fitted device should stay securely in place during normal toilet use. If your pessary does fall out, don't panic. You can wash it with soap and water and reinsert it if you have been shown how. Otherwise, simply store it safely and contact your practitioner to arrange for it to be refitted as soon as possible.

Are there any side effects or risks I should know about?
Pessaries are a very safe treatment, but like any medical device, there are potential side effects. The most common is an increase in vaginal discharge, which is usually harmless. Less frequently, some women may experience a slight odour, irritation, or minor bleeding. Regular follow-up appointments with your specialist are essential to monitor for any issues and ensure your vaginal health is maintained, significantly minimising any risks associated with long-term use.

How long can a pessary be used for? Do they need replacing?
A pessary can be a long-term solution for managing prolapse for many years. Depending on the type and your personal circumstances, it will be removed, cleaned, and reinserted by your practitioner every 4-6 months. During these appointments, the device is checked for any signs of wear. While they are made from durable medical-grade silicone, they are typically replaced every 12 months to ensure they remain effective and hygienic.

Can you have sex while wearing a pessary?
This depends on the type of pessary you have. Many designs, such as a ring pessary, do not block the vaginal canal and can be left in place during sexual intercourse, often without you or your partner noticing. However, other space-filling types, like a cube or Gellhorn pessary, must be removed beforehand. We encourage you to have an open conversation with your practitioner about your lifestyle so they can help you choose the most suitable option.

Who is the best professional to fit a pessary: a GP, gynaecologist, or a specialist physio?
In the UK, pessaries can be fitted by a specially trained GP, a gynaecologist, or a specialist pelvic health physiotherapist. While all are qualified, a specialist physio or gynaecologist often has more extensive, dedicated training in fitting a wide range of devices. A pelvic health physio can also provide a holistic treatment plan, combining the fitting with a personalised pelvic floor exercise programme to achieve the best possible outcome for you.

Does using a pessary mean I can stop doing my pelvic floor exercises?
Absolutely not. We view a pessary and pelvic floor exercises as a team working together to manage your prolapse. The pessary provides physical support to your organs, reducing your symptoms and allowing you to exercise more comfortably and effectively. Continuing with your tailored exercises is vital for strengthening your pelvic floor muscles, which provides active, long-term support. Combining both gives you the best chance of regaining control and confidence.
