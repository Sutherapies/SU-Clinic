<h1>What is a Pessary? A Gentle Guide to Non-Surgical Prolapse Support</h1>
<p class="muted">January 2026</p>

<p>
Living with the discomfort of pelvic organ prolapse—that feeling of heaviness, pressure, or a noticeable bulge—can be distressing and isolating.
If you’re worried about your symptoms but the thought of invasive surgery feels daunting, please know there is a gentle, effective, and non-surgical path forward.
</p>

<p>
This path often involves a simple, supportive device called a pessary. It’s a discreet solution designed to comfortably manage your symptoms,
helping you regain control and return to the activities you love.

<h2>Understanding the Pessary: A Simple Support System for Your Pelvic Floor</h2>

<p>
A pessary is a soft, flexible device made from medical-grade silicone. Think of it like a sports support or orthotic,
but designed specifically to help your internal pelvic organs.
</p>

<p>
It is inserted into the vagina to gently lift and support organs such as the bladder, uterus, or bowel,
often relieving pressure, bulging, and discomfort immediately.
</p>

<h3>What Does a Pessary Help With?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Pelvic organ prolapse (POP)</li>
  <li>Stress urinary incontinence</li>
  <li>Temporary pregnancy or postnatal support</li>
</ul>

<h3>How is a Pessary Different from Other Devices?</h3>
<p>
Unlike menstrual cups or contraceptive diaphragms, a pessary is designed purely for structural support
and long-term symptom management.

<h2>Common Types of Pessaries</h2>

<h3>The Ring Pessary</h3>

Often used for mild to moderate prolapse and can sometimes be self-managed.
</p>

Used for more significant prolapse and typically managed by a healthcare professional.

<h2>Your Pessary Fitting Journey</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Assessment</h3>
<p>
A private consultation and gentle internal examination help determine the right device.
</p>

<h3>Step 2: Fitting</h3>
<p>
A trial pessary is inserted and checked while you move, cough, and squat.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: Follow-up</h3>
<p>
Regular follow-ups ensure comfort, effectiveness, and vaginal health.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Will I feel the pessary?</h3>
<p>
No — a correctly fitted pessary should not be noticeable.
</p>

<h3>Can it fall out?</h3>
<p>
Rarely, if properly fitted. If it does, contact your practitioner.
